### FirthLight ###

FirthLight will turn on when it goes from light into darkness. It will stay on
for 30 seconds and then go off again. Just ideal for turning off the lights and
getting to the bed.


#### How It Works ####

Just put batteries in and it will start monitoring light intensity every second.


#### Configuration ####

To configure it, put magnet between chip and ICSP connector. The longer you hold
it, the longer light duration will be (configurable between 10 and 80 seconds).


#### Manufacturing ####

If you want to make this board your self, just grab the latest release and send
gerbers over to [OSH Park](http://oshpark.com/) (or any other PCB manufacturer
of your choice).

Inside the archive you will also find parts list and the latest firmware.
